**************************************************************

1. All Assignments are INDEPENDENT WORK !!  Absosulely no COPYING!!

2. Oral Quizz will be given during demo of your work.



                   SYSTEM SOFTWARE:

1. Website: http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples Directory:
            Sample Lab Assignments Solutions

2. Computers:
   Your laptops running Linux or equivalent.

===================== DO THESE in week 1 ===============================
3. Development Software:

   www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples/ contains 
 
       Dev86bin.tar.gz : 16-bit BCC development package

   Download to your Linux / directory.

   Run      zcat FILENAME.tar.gz | tar xvf -     
  
   to install BCC. Read man pages of bcc, as86 and ld86 to see how to use them.
   
4. Get QEMU:  Ubuntu:  apt-get install qemu-system-i386


5. ============= DEMO OS MTX of KCW ===============================
   MTX is a Unix-like OS designed and written entirely by KCW. 
   It can run on either REAL PCs or Virtual Machines. Get runnable MTX images at

      http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples/vdisk     # HARD   disk image
      http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples/mtximage  # FLOPPY disk image

(1). Run QEMU on vdisk:

         qemu -hda vdisk -smp 8 -m 512m -serial mon:stdio

     Then boot up MTX from partitions 

          1 (rmtx): MTX in 16-bit real mode
          2 (pmtx): MTX in 32-bit protected mode
          3 (smp) : SMP MTX in 32-bit protected mode
          4 (mtx32.1): MTX in 32-bit mode using segmentation

(2). When MTX starts, login as root
          login: root
          password: 12345

(3). Enter commands for sh to execute, just like in Unix/Linux

(4). Run QEMU on FD image:
         qemu -fda mtximage -no-fd-boochk -serial mon:stdio
